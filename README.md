# Automated-Parking-Solution
An automated voice generated parking solution which ensures security by detecting the vehicles which belong to the organization and after detecting the vehicle it generates audio telling the car person the nearest place to park in the lot.

NOTE: The Tensorflow-Custom object detection API for the detection of number plate which is the baseline to build this project.So you may clone the Tensorflow-Custom object detection API and start training your own classifier.Only the necessary files have been uploaded here.


Some sample screenshots of the application.
